**Flashing:**  

1. Copy `cxsw_update.tar.bz2` to the root of a FAT32 formatted microSD card.  
2. Turn on the device, wait for it to start, then insert the card. The stock firmware reads the `install.sh` script from this archive and flashes the new OpenWrt image.  
4. The box will create an AP `OpenWrt`- connect to it -> `ssh` and continue Wi-fi internet setup.
